* 1 - The server's "/" path returns an HTML file

* 1 - That HTML file includes at least  two links to other static files (CSS files, JS files, other HTML pages, images, etc.), and the server successfully serves them

* 1 - That AJAX request should include an argument that somehow varies based on that UI

* 1 - Whichever path is requested should return a JSON response

* 1 - Whatever is in that response should vary based on the endpoints "argument"
